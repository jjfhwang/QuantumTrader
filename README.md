## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm installed on your system. It is also recommended to have Redis installed locally or accessible via a remote server.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd QuantumTrader

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    npm install

4.  **Build the Project:**
    npm run build

## Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Define the following environment variables:
    *   `EXCHANGE_API_KEY`: Your API key for the desired cryptocurrency exchange (e.g., Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken).
    *   `EXCHANGE_API_SECRET`: Your API secret for the desired cryptocurrency exchange.
    *   `EXCHANGE_NAME`: The name of the exchange to use (e.g., "binance", "coinbasepro", "kraken").
    *   `REDIS_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of your Redis server (default: localhost).
    *   `REDIS_PORT`: The port number of your Redis server (default: 6379).

2.  **Configuration File:** A `config.json` file (example file provided) allows for further customization, such as setting default trading parameters, risk management rules, and backtesting configurations. Review and modify this file to align with your specific trading objectives and risk tolerance.

## Usage

1.  **Running the Platform:** After successful installation and configuration, you can start the platform using the following command:
    npm start

2.  **Developing Trading Strategies:** Create a new TypeScript file in the `src/strategies` directory. Implement your trading strategy by extending the `BaseStrategy` class. The `BaseStrategy` class provides access to market data, order execution functions, and risk management tools.

  *Example of simple strategy:*

  class SimpleMovingAverageStrategy extends BaseStrategy {
      constructor(config: StrategyConfig) {
          super(config);
      }

      async onTick(data: MarketData): Promise<void> {
          const sma = calculateSimpleMovingAverage(data.closePrices, 20);
          if (data.close > sma && !this.positionOpen) {
              await this.enterLongPosition(0.01);
          } else if (data.close < sma && this.positionOpen) {
              await this.exitLongPosition();
          }
      }
  }

  *Note: This is pseudo-code and requires further implementation details.*

3.  **Backtesting Strategies:** Use the backtesting engine to evaluate your trading strategies against historical market data. Configure the backtesting parameters in the `config.json` file and run the backtesting script using the following command:
    npm run backtest

  The backtesting engine will generate a detailed report of your strategy's performance, including profit factor, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.
