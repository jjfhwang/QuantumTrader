# QuantumTrader: Secure Algorithmic Crypto Trading Platform

A fully automated crypto trading platform utilizing secure enclave execution for credential protection, market data analysis, and algorithmic trading bot orchestration.

QuantumTrader is designed to provide a secure and efficient environment for automated cryptocurrency trading. In the high-stakes world of crypto, security is paramount. This platform addresses this need by leveraging secure enclave technology to protect sensitive information like API keys and trading algorithms from unauthorized access. QuantumTrader automates the entire trading process, from logging into exchanges and harvesting relevant market data to executing trades based on pre-defined algorithmic strategies. The core principle is to abstract away the complexities of interacting directly with various exchange APIs and to provide a centralized, secure, and programmable interface for managing trading activities.

The platform supports multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to diversify their trading strategies across different markets. It's built with modularity in mind, enabling easy integration of new exchanges, algorithms, and security features. The secure enclave provides a trusted execution environment, isolating critical components from the host operating system and reducing the attack surface. This mitigates the risk of credential theft and ensures the integrity of trading algorithms. QuantumTrader empowers users to implement sophisticated trading strategies with confidence, knowing that their sensitive data and trading logic are protected.

By automating the trading process and providing a secure environment, QuantumTrader aims to increase trading efficiency and reduce the risk of human error. The platform's modular design allows for continuous improvement and adaptation to the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape. Furthermore, the extensive logging and monitoring capabilities provide valuable insights into trading performance, enabling users to refine their strategies and optimize their returns. This project is ideal for developers and quantitative traders looking for a secure and reliable platform for building and deploying automated trading bots.

## Key Features

*   **Secure Enclave Execution:** All sensitive operations, including API key storage and algorithmic execution, are performed within a secure enclave using Intel SGX. This protects against memory attacks and unauthorized access, guaranteeing credential security. We use the `sgx-sdk` TypeScript package for secure enclave interactions.
*   **Multi-Exchange Support:** Currently supports Binance, Coinbase Pro, and Kraken APIs. The platform is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new exchanges through a standardized interface. Exchange integration is implemented using exchange-specific TypeScript classes inheriting from a base `ExchangeClient` abstract class.
*   **Market Data Aggregation:** Aggregates real-time market data from multiple exchanges, providing a comprehensive view of the crypto market. Utilizes Websocket connections for streaming data updates and historical data APIs for backtesting. Market data is normalized and stored in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for analysis.
*   **Algorithmic Trading Bot Orchestration:** Enables the deployment and management of multiple trading bots, each executing a specific algorithmic strategy. Bots are implemented as TypeScript classes implementing a `TradingBot` interface, allowing for flexible strategy development. A central orchestrator manages the lifecycle of each bot.
*   **Credential Harvesting and Management:** Securely harvests and stores API credentials within the secure enclave. Utilizes encryption and access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. Credentials are encrypted using AES-256 and stored in a secure database managed within the enclave.
*   **Real-time Monitoring and Logging:** Provides real-time monitoring of trading activity, system performance, and security events. Comprehensive logging facilitates auditing and debugging. Logging is implemented using a centralized logging service that aggregates logs from all components.
*   **Backtesting Framework:** Includes a comprehensive backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies using historical market data. Backtesting results are visualized using interactive charts and statistical reports. The framework allows for simulating different trading scenarios and optimizing strategy parameters.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language used for the entire platform. TypeScript's static typing enhances code maintainability and reduces runtime errors.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code. Node.js provides a scalable and efficient platform for building server-side applications.
*   **Intel SGX:** Secure Enclave technology for protecting sensitive data and code. Provides a trusted execution environment for critical operations.
*   **gRPC:** Used for inter-process communication between the main application and the secure enclave. gRPC provides a high-performance and efficient communication protocol.
*   **WebSockets:** For real-time market data streaming from exchanges. Provides low-latency updates for trading decisions.
*   **InfluxDB (Optional):** A time-series database for storing and analyzing market data. Provides efficient storage and retrieval of time-stamped data.
*   **Jest:** Unit testing framework for ensuring code quality and reliability.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (version 16 or higher)
    *   npm (or yarn)
    *   Intel SGX SDK and drivers installed and configured. Refer to Intel's documentation for specific instructions based on your operating system.
    *   Docker (Optional, for running InfluxDB)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuantumTrader.git
    cd QuantumTrader

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    npm install

4.  **Build the secure enclave:**
    cd enclave
    npm install
    npm run build

5.  **Build the main application:**
    cd ..
    npm run build

## Configuration

The platform requires several environment variables to be configured before running. These variables should be set in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

*   `BINANCE_API_KEY`: Your Binance API key.
*   `BINANCE_API_SECRET`: Your Binance API secret.
*   `COINBASE_PRO_API_KEY`: Your Coinbase Pro API key.
*   `COINBASE_PRO_API_SECRET`: Your Coinbase Pro API secret.
*   `COINBASE_PRO_PASSPHRASE`: Your Coinbase Pro passphrase.
*   `KRAKEN_API_KEY`: Your Kraken API key.
*   `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`: Your Kraken API secret.
*   `INFLUXDB_URL` (Optional): The URL of your InfluxDB instance.
*   `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` (Optional): The authentication token for InfluxDB.
*   `ENCLAVE_PATH`: Path to the compiled enclave library (e.g., `enclave/dist/enclave.so`).

Example `.env` file:

BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret
COINBASE_PRO_API_KEY=your_coinbase_pro_api_key
COINBASE_PRO_API_SECRET=your_coinbase_pro_api_secret
COINBASE_PRO_PASSPHRASE=your_coinbase_pro_passphrase
KRAKEN_API_KEY=your_kraken_api_key
KRAKEN_API_SECRET=your_kraken_api_secret
INFLUXDB_URL=http://localhost:8086
INFLUXDB_TOKEN=your_influxdb_token
ENCLAVE_PATH=./enclave/dist/enclave.so

## Usage

To start the platform, run the following command:

npm start

This will start the main application, which will initialize the secure enclave and start the trading bot orchestrator.

Example of interacting with the API programmatically (assuming an endpoint exposing trading functionality):

import axios from 'axios';

async function placeOrder(symbol: string, side: 'buy' | 'sell', quantity: number, price: number) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/api/trade', {
      symbol,
      side,
      quantity,
      price,
    });
    console.log('Order placed successfully:', response.data);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Error placing order:', error.message);
  }
}

placeOrder('BTCUSDT', 'buy', 0.01, 30000);

Detailed API documentation, including endpoints for managing bots, accessing market data, and retrieving trading history, will be provided in a separate documentation file.
